# Telegram Bot API

Original project [telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api) 

The scope of that project is just to provide a wrapper around the API.
This fork will bring many disruptive changes.
It not pulls request to the original project.
Maybe, someday in the future, it will become a separate project, but now I'm lack a good idea.
